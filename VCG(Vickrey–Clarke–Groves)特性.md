# Truthfulness真实性

> **Truth-telling** is a **dominant strategy** under Groves mechanisms

讲真话是Groves机制下的主导策略

# Uniqueness独特性

> Theorem by Green-La↵ont (informal statement): in settings where agents may have unrestricted quasilinear utilities, Groves mechanisms are the only mechanisms that are both **efficient** and **dominant-strategy truthful.**

finding the social-welfare maximising choice might be hard

# Individual Rationality的两个性质

### Choice-set monotonicity(选择集单调性)

> removing any agent weakly decreases—-that is, never increases—the mechanism’s set of possible choices X.

### No negative externalities

> every agent has zero or positive utility for any choice that can be made without her participation

eg：road referendum

Consider the problem of holding a referendum to decide whether or not to build a road.

- The set of choices is independent of the number of agents, satisfying choice-set monotonicity.（选择集与代理的数量无关，满足选择集单调性）
- No agent negatively values the project, though some might value the situation in which the project is not undertaken more highly than the situation in which it is.（没有代理人对项目有负面评价，尽管有些代理人可能重视项目未实施的情况比实际情况更高）

**当VCG满足这两个条件，他就是ex post individually rational**

#### 定义

https://algorithmic-game-1316943030.cos.ap-nanjing.myqcloud.com/VCG6.png

存在一个选择x`，该选择在没有i的情况下时可行的，并且value大于等于X的

#### example

Consider a single-item auction. Dropping an agent reduces the amount of competition, making the others better o↵.

# 对于VCG来说

> The VCG mechanism is weakly budget-balanced when the no single-agent effect property holds

证明：

All agents truthfully declare their valuations in equilibrium. We must show that the sum of transfers (i.e. payments) from agents to the center is greater than or equal to zero.
